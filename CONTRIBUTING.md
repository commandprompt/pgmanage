# Contributing to PgManage

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and
transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Asking questions
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer


## PgManage Database Support

Currently PgManage supports `PostgreSQL`, `Oracle`, `MySQL`,`SQLite` and `MariaDB`. 
Suggestions and even pull requests for other databases are welcome.


## PgManage Operating System Support

We currently build PgManage for Debian/Ubuntu, Windows and OSX.


## PgManage Repositories

- [https://github.com/commandprompt/pgmanage](https://github.com/commandprompt/pgmanage): Main
application and server, deployment scripts and tests.


## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as
accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo.
2. Checkout `dev` branch.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Issue that pull request to the `dev` branch.

Note that the `dev` branch is only used in the main repo. For other repos, issue
your pull request to the `master` branch.


## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be
under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that
covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.


## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/commandprompt/pgmanage)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by
[opening a new issue](https://github.com/commandprompt/pgmanage); it's that
easy!


## Write bug reports with detail

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- PgManage flavor you are using (app or server) and version
- Operating system and version
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
